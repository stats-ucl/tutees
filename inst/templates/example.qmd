Dear Friend,

This is a message to demonstrate how the email would be created, starting from some markdown text.

I can obviously include some fancy formatting (like, for instance, using *italics* or **bold** text). 

The file with the message can be saved as `rmarkdown` (with extension `.Rmd`), or as a newer [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) (extension `.qmd`). It can contain plain text with virtually no formatting, or can even use `R` variables, e.g. to read data from a spreadsheet/data frame. For instance, this code 
```
Sys.Date() |> format("%A, %-d %B %Y")
```
would read in the current date (rendered as: {Sys.Date() |> format("%A, %-d %B %Y")}).

At the end of the message, you can include a signature, with hyperlinks (see below).

Best wishes,    
Gianluca
