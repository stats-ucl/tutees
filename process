# It is possible to use Microsoft365R to manage OneDrive files. These can't be opened 
# directly from R, but can be downloaded and then imported into R and at the end of the
# processing uploaded back onto the cloud.
#
# It is possible to use 
get_business_onedrive()
# to log-in to Microsoft365. The command 
get_business_onedrive(auth_type="device_code")
# allows to do it with no browser (R issues a code and instructions to log-in. 
# The log-in only needs to happen once and then issueing the simple command
# with no inputs just works).
#
# Commands like
od=get_business_onedrive()
od$download_file("path_to_the_file_in_OneDrive",dest="local_path"))
data=readxl::read_xlsx("local_path",sheet=...)
# create an object 'data' with the online spreadsheet's content.
# This can be manipulated/used to make operations and if changed 
# can be uploaded using a command like
writexl::write_excel(data,path="local_path")
od$upload_file("local_path",dest="path_to_the_file_in_OneDrive")
